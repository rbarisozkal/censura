    <h3>What is censura?</h3>
    <p>
      Censura is a platform where we can post comments, suggestions or critiques
      about a context which we choose.
    </p>
    <h3>How to use censura?</h3>
    <p>
      Firstly we have to decide a context to be posted. Let's say that I want to
      make a suggestion for a song "cardigan" by Taylor Swift. We find that song from Songs pages
      then we simply make our comment.
    </p>
    <h3>Messaging with friends</h3>
    <p>
      We can interact with people who's taste is as good as yours!
